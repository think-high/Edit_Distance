		///\\\*** Edit distance(Levenshtein distance) graphical implementation using openGl ***///\\\

(*)Description:

The edit distance between two strings is the number of single character manipulations (insertion, deletion or replacement) that are needed to transform one string into the other. 
The edit distance algorithm helps us find this minimum number of edits used to convert one string to another using operations which are all either at equal or varying costs.

(*)Applications of this algorithm:

Spell checkers in text editors, search engines, etc.
Correction systems for optical character recognition
Natural language translation

(*)
* Run the source code in "code-blocks" compiler.
* follow the instructions in the given program to run source code effectively.

* USE '+' to magnify the table.
* USE '-' to zoom in the table.
* USE 'w', 'a', 's', 'd' to move the table in the given window if the table does not fit the screen.


***NOTE: You should have opengl Libraries attached to your code-blocks(or any other) compiler.
